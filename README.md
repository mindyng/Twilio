# Twilio
telecom reinvented


Texting App using Python
::from command line to phone!::

How to do it too:

1. Create an account on Twilio
2. Verify a phone# on Twilio you would like to text (I used my own phone. You can use your friend's. Up to you).
3. Get Twilio Credentials: Account SID, Auth Token
4. Get Phone Numbers: On top of the phone# you will be texting to, you need a phone# from Twilio.
5. Put Twilio credentials and phone#'s in credentials.py.
6. Open your cmd and install pip install Twilio.
7. Run 'send_sms.py'

Whatever you declared as your my_msg was sent to your phone!
Woo hoo!!
